How to run the game locally:

1. Install Python 3.x and pip. Check in terminal: "python --version" and "pip --version". If you don't have it, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Flask in the project folder: "pip install flask".
3. Run the backend in terminal: "python app.py". You should see: "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000".
4. Open the frontend in a browser at "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/index.html". You will see a 3×3 board and you can play against the computer. Clicking "New Game" resets the board.

Notes: Do not run "solution.py" directly, only "app.py"
